# The Plan:
to create a flipper zero app

the app is a game that is played as following,
the user is showen a the direction pad of the flipper, 
and on it there is a series of button presses displayed by the coresponding button lighting up,
for each series, the user replicates correctly, their score is increased by +1,
and the series gets on button press longer 
(starts at 1 then with every succesful repetition of the series, the emount of presses is encreased)
the series is incemented with a randomly generated addition to it with every succsesful repetition
